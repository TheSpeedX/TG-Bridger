   - One - Many Bridging
   - Many - Many Bridging
 - Filter Message By Regex
 
### How To Use

- Get your Telegram API ID, API HASH from [Telegram](https://my.telegram.org/apps).
- Paste API ID and HASH in `.env` file
- Install requirements by `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Then Build a config file running `python config.py` 
- Finally, run Code by `python bot.py`

####  Note
 - If you can't receive or read message, Make sure your account have permission.  
 - If you are running code in AWS, you possibly can't login as Telegram blocks login requests from AWS. A workaround will be logging in  locally and using the session file in AWS.  

This code was part of a freelance project. The code might be unstable and might not be actively maintained.  
Any contribution is highly appreciated.
